## Overview

Powered by cutting-edge AI models and wrapped in a Streamlit interface, this app lets you transform plain text prompts into mesmerizing visual masterpieces.

## Technical Features

- **Neural Model**: Leverages the power of the LLM model for image generation, image transfer, audio generation, speech generation and summary generation, providing detailed and accurate depictions.
- **Streamlit Framework**: Built atop the versatile Streamlit library, ensuring a smooth and responsive UI/UX.
- **Dynamic Customization**: You can peek "under the hood", tune hyperparameters like guidance_scale, prompt_strength, and more for fine-grained control.
- **Gallery**: A curated gallery for inspiration, showcasing the prowess of the underlying model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Klayand/ai-appliaction_platform.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AI_applications
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Rename the `.streamlit/example_secrets.toml` file to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.

5. Paste your Replicate API token in the secrets.toml file:

   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN = "paste-your-replicate-api-token-here"
   OPENAI_API_TOKEN = "paste-your-replicate-api-token-here"
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```python
   streamlit run üè†_Home.py
   or
   python main.py 
   ```

2. Navigate to the provided local URL, and voila! Start crafting your visual narratives.
